# TheLostGrimoire
A mod for Pathfinder : Kingmaker that add new option for wizards (Arcane Discoveries)
**Disclamer**: This mod has not been heavily tested, yet. So some things may be unbalanced. Let me now if they are. 
Also, respect to the base material wasn't always the focus of this mod, rather I tried to make the Feat and Abiliies added as balanced as I could for the game.

**[Arcane Discoveries](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-discoveries/arcane-discoveries-paizo/):**

- [Alchemical Affinity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-discoveries/arcane-discoveries-paizo/alchemical-affinity/)
- [Forest Blessing](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-discoveries/arcane-discoveries-paizo/forest-s-blessing/)
- [Feral Speech](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-discoveries/arcane-discoveries-paizo/feral-speech/): Adapted for the game as an ability that allow to make persuasion check to try to charm or even dominate animal (and later on Vermin) 
- [Golem Constructor](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-discoveries/arcane-discoveries-paizo/golem-constructor/) : Adapted for the game as a pet, see *Golem Companion*, below
- [Idealize](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-discoveries/arcane-discoveries-paizo/idealize-su/)
- [Immortality](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-discoveries/arcane-discoveries-paizo/immortality/): Allow to ignore penalty from the Amulet of Dying Wisdom and the Older Hero feat (see below)
- [Knowledge is Power](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-discoveries/arcane-discoveries-paizo/knowledge-is-power-ex/)
- [Opposition Research](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-discoveries/arcane-discoveries-paizo/opposition-research/) : A new implementation of this feat, that will be available alongside the one from unearthed arcana
- [Resilient Illusions](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-discoveries/arcane-discoveries-paizo/resilient-illusions/)
- [Staff-Like Wand](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-discoveries/arcane-discoveries-paizo/staff-like-wand/) : If you use the Craft Magic Item mod then the prerequisite should be Craft Wand, if not it will be Skill Focus(UMD)

**New Feat** 
- Older Hero : Allow you to make an older character as per pnp [rules](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alignment-description/description/#Age), except it's a feat(For balance reason: warrior will never take this option and it is really advantageous for caster)). 
The amulet of dying wisdom have been modified to not stack with this feat.

**Golem Companion**



**Bugs Fix**
- Added the Force descriptor to Magic Missile and Battering Blast
- Added the Polymorph descriptor to Baleful Polymorph
