# TheLostGrimoire
A mod for Pathfinder : Kingmaker that add new option for wizards (Arcane Discoveries)

The scope of this mod is to make add more option to wizard character and to make the wizard class a bit better so that it isn't simply a "bad sorcerer". 

**Disclamer**: ***This mod has not been heavily tested, yet. So some things may be unbalanced. Let me now if they are or not.  Users should make a hard save before installing this mod and should be ready to use the respec option (either from mod or the base game option) to revert some of the change brought by this mod or to account for future update.***

Also, respect to the base material wasn't always the focus of this mod, rather I tried to make the Feat and Abiliies added as balanced as I could for the game.

This fea doesn't work for Thassilonian Specialist by design.

**New Feat** 
- Older Hero : Allow you to make an older character as per pnp [rules](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alignment-description/description/#Age), except it's a feat(For balance reason: warrior will never take this option and it is really advantageous for caster). 
The amulet of dying wisdom have been modified to not stack with this feat.

**Golem Companion**

This is the part of the mod that is heavily adapted and depart from the pnp rule: 
1) You don't have to build the golem: selecting the feat give you a permanent pet, like animal companion. The construct companion gain ability and power as they gain level (Gainnig Strength, Ac, DR, Attack and Saves Bonus, and Also the spell immunity at higher level). 
2) The construct don't have their pnp spell vulnerability/advantage (special effects that happen when specifique spell are casted at them). It is again for balance reason: the AI wouldn't know how to use the vulnerability so it would only be an advantage for the wizard and be a bit much to powerful in certain case.
3) The pet level is tied to your wizard level 
4) The pet upgrade like animal companion, but at level 11
5) I tried to follow pnp rule when I could for the construct stats but often deviated from it for balance reason (A level 9 wizard with a by pnp rule Steam Dragon would be op). 
6) This pet is not intented to be as strong as an Animal companion, it's intented to be a nice help but nothing more. I'm not sure that this goal have been achieved, I couldn't test all the construct companion options for all the level range. 

For now there is only five pet option: 
- Ice Golem   
- Mud Golem  
- Steam Dragon (It's in fact the clockwork dragon but clockworks couldn't be done using base game asset)
- Stone Golem
- Scarecrow

All the construct can't be healed using the normal spell and can't be resurected (you have to rest for that). So Taking the feat add an ability named "Patch Construct" to the wizard that allow to heal the construct 3 time day at a cost of 2 diamond dust. 
It isn't much and is costly, so there are also new spell to heal and improve your golem : 
- Make whole: Lvl 2, Restore a bit of Hp to the golem
- Make whole greater: Lvl 4, Restore more hp to the golem
- Rapid Repair: lvl 5, The golem Gain Fast Healing (5) for a short time 
- Unbreakable Construct: Lvl 5, The golem gain a bonus Dr of 5/Adamantine that stacks with its exhisting DR
- Code Skill :lvl 3, The golem gain bonus in Athletics, Mobility, Perception equal to its level, If it allready has rank in the skill it instead gain the skill as a class skill. 
- Program Feat:lvl 5, The golem gain some feats depending on your choice, the option are: Attack (Gain weapon focus and Improved critical for all its primary weapon), Resistance (Toughness, Lightning Reflexe, Great Fortitude, Iron Will), Coopperation (Precise Strike and Outflank)

Future Balance tweak:
As I said, I don't really know how well this feat is balanced, so future option to fix OP companion are in consideration if the comments of the mod tell me it is unbalanced. Here are the option for now:

- Adjusting the Companion Stats and Ability
- Making the Construct not resurecting on rest and Adding an ability to do it manually (costing diamond dust) 
- Making the consctruct not act on the master death 
- Scraping the spell immunity altogether (if it is the cause of the balance problem)

**Bugs Fix**
- Added the Force descriptor to Magic Missile and Battering Blast
- Added the Polymorph descriptor to Baleful Polymorph


**Future Plans:**

More Arcane Discoveries: 
- Ioun Bond : long term project, I'll see if the mod works well first. But it would add Ioun Stones to the game.
- True Name: also a long term project
- Faith magic: maybe
- Steward of the great Beyond

More Spells, maybe, and feat (don't hesitate to suggest some). At one point I may also do one or two new wizard Archetype. 

Also at one point I'll add the mod content to some npc (when it make sense and don't require new AI tweak).

**What I won't Do:**
- Command Undead (I've other plan for necromancer)
- Lichdom
- Simulacrum, Gate, Planar Binding or other complicated spell that would change the game to much or would be op in the game
- All things non related to wizard
